# Planning State: OptimusCtx

**Initialized:** 2026-03-14
**Project reference:** `.planning/PROJECT.md`
**Roadmap reference:** `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
**Requirements reference:** `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
**Status:** Executing phase 1

## Project Memory

- Product: OptimusCtx is a local-first runtime that builds and maintains a persistent per-repository context index for coding agents.
- Core promise: repository understanding should be persistent, deterministic, incremental, and reusable across agent clients.
- v1 stack direction: Go runtime, SQLite persistence, Tree-sitter structural extraction, MCP-over-STDIO integration.
- v1 guardrails: no hosted dependency, no default semantic retrieval, no automatic instruction-file edits, no IDE/LSP replacement scope.
- Roadmap shape: six standard-granularity phases ordered by dependency from state foundation through refresh, extraction, query surface, MCP contracts, and operational hardening.

## Current Planning Context

- Active milestone: v1 foundation
- Active phase: Phase 1 - Bootstrap, Repository Discovery, and Persistent State
- Next planning action: execute Wave 3 plan `01-04`
- Coverage status: all 35 v1 requirements are mapped exactly once in `.planning/ROADMAP.md` and `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`

## Recent Decisions

- Repository root detection now canonicalizes the start path, prefers Git top-level discovery, and falls back to an existing `.optimusctx` directory only when Git metadata is absent.
- Repository discovery walks directories in lexical order, records explicit ignore reasons, and does not traverse symlinks in Phase 1.
- File metadata records now include language hint, SHA-256 `content_hash`, filesystem mod time, and `last_indexed_at` for included files so later persistence work can consume them directly.

## Notes

- This file initializes project memory for future planning and execution turns.
- Update this state whenever the active phase, milestone, or planning status changes.
- Plan `01-01` is complete with a working Go CLI scaffold, version output, and bootstrap documentation.
- Plan `01-02` is complete with repository root detection, ignore-aware discovery, and persistence-ready metadata records under `internal/repository`.
- Plan `01-03` is complete with repository-local `.optimusctx` layout helpers, SQLite migrations, and store initialization under `internal/state` and `internal/store`.
- Verification for `01-01` used a local Go toolchain installed under `/tmp/optimusctx-go`.
- Verification for `01-02` also used `/tmp/optimusctx-go/go/bin/go` with `GOCACHE` and `GOMODCACHE` redirected into `/tmp`.
- Verification for `01-03` used the same `/tmp/optimusctx-go` toolchain and `/tmp` Go caches for SQLite-backed tests.
